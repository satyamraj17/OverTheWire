# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called --spaces in this filename-- located in the home directory.

# Solution
As in the previous task, we can use a relative path. We can either press tab after entering the name a bit or write the whole name in single quotes.
```
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename-- 
MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./'--spaces in this filename--'
MNk8KNH3Usiio41PRUEoDFPqfxLPlSmx
```
